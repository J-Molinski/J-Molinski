<div align="center">**I'm Jordan Molinski, a fourth year Environmental Science major born and raised in Davis, California. When not a student, i work part-time at Farmer's Markets in Los Angeles selling sustainable seafood for a local company. While my time at UCSB will shortly come to a close, i hope to further my education by getting a master's degree in something slightly more specific than environmental science, whether it be more related to toxicology or engineering. Some of my passions and favorite pastimes include playing and watching soccer, taking my dog on hikes, or going backpacking in California's pristine wilderness**
